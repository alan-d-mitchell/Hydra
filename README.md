# Hydra

A statically-typed programming language inspired by hatred of Java :)

---

## 🚀 Current Status

Hydra is currently in the **language specification phase**. The core syntax and features have been designed, and the project is focused on building the foundational compiler and toolchain.

The language is not yet ready for production use. The primary goal is to stabilize the specification and deliver an initial compiler implementation.

## 📜 Documentation

For a detailed look at syntax, examples, and language constructs, please refer to the official [**Grammar Reference (grammar.md)**](grammar.md).

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are highly welcome! Since the language is in its early stages, there is plenty of room for discussion and improvement. If you have ideas, find issues with the current specification, or would like to help with the implementation, please open an issue or submit a pull request to get involved.
